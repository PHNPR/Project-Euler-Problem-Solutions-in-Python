# Project Euler Problem Solutions in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python solutions for various problems from Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

## Contents

- Each problem is organized in its own Python file (e.g., `1.py`, `2.py`, etc.).
- A separate `utils.py` file contains commonly used utility functions that are reused across multiple solutions.
- The `README.md` file provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to run the solutions.
